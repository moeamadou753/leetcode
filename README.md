# leetcode
A Repo to keep track of my solutions to leetcode problems in my "30 days of leetcode challenge" and interview preparation at large

## Navigating the repository
Within each folder containing a problem title, there will be a markdown file discussing my approach, knowledge obtained and gaps to fill in the future, and areas for further optimization.
